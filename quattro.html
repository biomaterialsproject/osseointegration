            C: Hello and welcome to our podcast! In this series, we'll explore osseointegrationâ€”what it is, the challenges it presents, the current evaluation techniques, and potential solutions. 

 

<br>C: Here we are with our expert, (nome), and today we'll discuss the general definition of osseointegration. When was it first discovered, and how is it evolving today? 

<br>L: Good morning everyone, the first definition was given by Dr. Branemark who described osseointegration  as: "a direct contact- on light microscopic level- between living bone and implant". 

<br>L: In general, we can say that osteointegration is the biological process through which a medical implant directly anchorage by the formation of bony tissue around it without growth of fibrous tissue at the interface between the bone and implant. 

<br>L: Actually, the definition of osseointegration has slightly changed through the years and even now researchers continue to give different interpretations of the term. 

<br>C: Why is it so difficult to find a unique definition?  

<br>L: Currently, it is difficult to say how good the anchorage of the implant is because the ex
